## Your Fired Up Command Line

`Fire` is a fun module that allows for providing a quick and beautiful command line interface on top of a Python module. `Fired Up` adds some baseclasses and conventions to make this experience even more fun, by adding the possibility to chain multiple top-level commands/classes, using a shared clipboard.
